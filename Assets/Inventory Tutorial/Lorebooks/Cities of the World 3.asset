  displayedTitle: III. Istia
  text: "Istia is the capital of the great northern empire of the moose. In the 15th
    century BSC, the ancient moose clans migrated west, filling the vacuum left by
    the retreat of the bear tribes and introducing iron-working to the North. By
    the end of the 8th century, the moose had migrated further west beyond South
    Pass and driven the reindeer out of the Istis river valley, where they founded
    the fortress city of Istia high in the mountains.\n\tThe moose of Istia are renowned
    for their skill as smiths and have proven formidable opponents, bringing even
    the warlike bears of Geom under their power as a client state. Their territory
    has also grown to include Graslan in the lower Istis valley and Sylvitos in the
    woodlands south of Bergen Pass. Despite their growing wealth and political influence,
    the moose kings maintain their ancient martial traditions. It is said that the
    heir to throne must prove their worth by lifting the Great Mace, an ancestral
    weapon rumored to weigh several hundred pounds, or lose their place to a worthier
    successor."
