  displayedTitle: II. Agros
  text: "Agros is the capital of the Saberian kingdom, founded in the fertile land
    along the eastern shores of the Voracine Sea. Its favorable position on the overland
    route from the North to Myriolan has made King Sabre VII fabulously wealthy.
    But with this new prosperity, the formerly war-like sabres have developed a reputation
    for luxury and vice.\n\tThe territory of Agros in ancient times was called Faelin,
    or the \u201CLand of the Cats,\u201D for its large feline population. The original
    inhabitants were gradually driven out following the unification of the sabre
    tribes in the 5th century BSC. By the end of the Second War of the Cats in the
    1st century SC, the sabres had seized the whole of Faelin and secured the lions
    and elephants of the savannah as their vassals. \r\nAround this time, Sabre IV
    \u2018the Pious\u2019 pledged to uphold the eternal autonomy of Sanctuary and
    the newly-founded Order. Although his famous piety was likely prompted by the
    mysterious sudden death of Sabre III as he was setting out for war against Sanctuary,
    all subsequent Sabre kings have upheld the pledge."
