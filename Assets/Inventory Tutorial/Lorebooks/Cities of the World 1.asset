  text: "Sanctuary is the center of the Sphero-Squishian religion, founded around
    the Holy Mount on the shores of the Voracine Sea. More than four centuries ago,
    on New Year\u2019s Day, the Fourth Prophet deposited the Tome of Revelation in
    a cave on the slopes of the Mount and subsequently vanished from the earth. This
    event marked the foundation of the new religion of the Great Sphere and Squish
    United and the first year of the new calendar (1 SC). The site attracted many
    pilgrims from the surrounding area and a Sanctuary for the faithful was formally
    consecrated by the new Knightly and Priestly Orders of the Sphere and Squish
    in 54 SC. \n\tMany of the first inhabitants of Sanctuary were refugees from the
    Second War of the Cats, at the conclusion of which Sabre IV pledged to uphold
    the autonomy of the holy city. As the result of successful missions to the North
    at the end of the 1st century SC, Sanctuary soon became an important destination
    for pilgrims from as far as Mousepile and the Istis river valley. Since the unification
    on the Knightly and Priestly Orders at the end of the First Crusade, the Archpriest
    of the Grand Synod has been the official ruler of the Sanctuary and wields enormous
    influence over the crusader kingdoms.\r\nToday, the Holy Mount is covered with
    shrine and temples while the lower valley is filled with countless inns for pilgrims.
    Sanctuary also boasts a sprawling market selling religious trinkets and an active
    port."
