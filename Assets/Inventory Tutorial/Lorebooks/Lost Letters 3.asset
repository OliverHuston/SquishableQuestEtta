  text: "The resolution of the Council of Eight, made after deliberation at the 791st
    session of the New Council having met at Gharna, bearing the blessed assent of
    the Holy Idols:\n\tLet these words be sent into the lands of the unbelievers
    and spoken before the King Onosdacer: In old times, unbeliever bore sword against
    believer and believer against unbeliever, but now peace is in the lands and by
    common compact all swords be sheathed. Yet this Council complains that the King
    Onosdacer has conducted himself dishonorably when he let the lawless peoples
    of the desert pass through his land unmolested and come into the lands of the
    believers to strike at sacred heads. For, we say, the tribesmen of the desert
    do not respect the Holy Idols nor do they share in your same unbelief but rather
    do service to the ancient powers of Old Etta. Their curses and swords shall bring
    no peace to the King Onosdacer or to the Council of Eight; therefore, let these
    evil-doers be slain wherever they be seen or even sought out to be righteously
    slaughtered, and let them no more pass through the King\u2019s lands with impunity.
    These are the matters the Council has decreed be spoken in the presence of King
    Onosdacer and his knights that they may be considered and agreed to in the presence
    of his court."
