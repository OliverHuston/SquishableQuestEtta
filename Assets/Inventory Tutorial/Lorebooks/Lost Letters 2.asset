  text: "Plithius Runius, Quartermaster General of Fort Munnis, to the Grandmaster
    of the Brotherhood of Dawn at Mesia.\n\tI beseech your eminence to speak in his
    heaven-sent voice against a terrible storm of ills which has befallen the knightly
    garrison of Fort Munnis. For, as it long has been, merchants plying their trade
    do often bring their wares to sell in our keep and thus supply the knights and
    men-at-arms with many necessities. But, your eminence, with the stern hand of
    Necessity does come also the beguiling touch of Luxury, and of the luxuries brought
    by merchants, there is none so fearsome as that pernicious novelty called \u201CKing
    Sabre\u2019s Delight.\u201D\n\tThis confection, you may know, is in its greatest
    part composed of cake, yellow in color and rather spongey, much endowed with
    the sweetness of sugar and the richness of butter. But yet within this body,
    there is a cavity, a certain hollow or cave, into which the bakers pour a soft
    cream. Thus, to the one enjoying the cake, the inner cream appears all of a sudden,
    much to their delight, and in this way, completely overwhelms even the souls
    most fortified against temptations.\n\tThough this \u201Cdelight\u201D may be
    suited to the gentle and luxurious lands of King Sabre, it is by no means fitting
    for the knights of this garrison. For while it has an attractive taste and appearance,
    the cake lacks all wholesome succor which is necessary for a holy knight, providing
    only the sweetness of its false promise. I am greatly reminded of the parable
    of heron and the empty mollusk shell and have given it much study as of late.
    Let us be now like the heron who flies at last to sea, abandoning its vain pursuits.
    May you banish these \u201CDelights of King Sabre\u201D from all the lands of
    the Brotherhood, just as is banished the seditious plotter, whose presence corrupts
    the hearts of the people. Your eminence, I beseech you by your knees, free our
    bodies from this pestilence and, thus too, our souls.\n\tSent from Fort Munnis
    by swift messenger on the Springtime Feast of St. Dor, in the year 433 by Corsan
    Reckoning."
