  text: "Sir Grenactorius, honorable knight of the Brotherhood of the Sunflower,
    to his majesty King Onosdacer of the Atronne.\r\n\tMy king, may you take it not
    ill that my congratulations on your coronation have come perhaps later than most,
    for you surely understand that the question of the kingship was for a long time
    plunged in uncertainty whether the crown would pass to a sworn brother of the
    Sunflower or a brother of the First Spring. But it has passed unto the latter,
    you, my king, and not unto the noble Sir Vaunin, my brother by oath; the Sphere
    and Squish have shown us their will for this time, and thus I bow before your
    royal head.\r\nI hail thee king! My son, the honorable Sir Golo, hails thee king!
    The knights and armsmen of Castle Cras hail thee king! Blessed by thy reign and
    long. Be it free from faction and dissention among the Brotherhoods and may the
    divine gifts of the gods rain upon every head in the land! \r\nSent by pidgeon
    on St. Tosten\u2019s Eve, Fall of the year 398.\r\n\r\n"
